    <h3>Hello! We are The Great Auction! And we can help you to buy any things you like!</h3>
    <p>Cars, phones, coins, clothes, paintings... There are a lot of things that you can find on our website.</p>
    <p>The word "auction" is derived from the Latin augeō, which means "I increase" or "I augment". For most of history, auctions have been a relatively uncommon way to negotiate the exchange of goods and commodities. In practice, both haggling and sale by set-price have been significantly more common. Indeed, before the seventeenth century the few auctions that were held were sporadic.</p>
